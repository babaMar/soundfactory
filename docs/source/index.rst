Welcome to soundfactory's documentation!
========================================

`soundfactory` is a simple tool to play and be creative with audio taking a data-oriented approach.
It comes from some scripts I have been writing a few years back and thought about
having few reusable core modules and a command-line tool for researching new sounds.

And I wanted to be able to develop it in my Jupyter Notebook of course!

The ``signal_builder`` and the ``signal_plotter`` core modules implement respectively
the ``SignalBuilder`` and ``SignalPlotter`` classes that allow to easily create
and analyse audio samples in a programmatic way.
