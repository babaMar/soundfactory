`soundfactory` is a simple tool to play and be creative with audio taking a data-oriented approach.
It comes from some scripts I have been writing a few years back and thought about
having few reusable core modules and a command-line tool for researching new sounds.
And I wanted to be able to develop it and have fun with it in my Jupyter Notebook of course!
